            <h1>Prodigy and genius</h1>
            <p>
                Von Neumann was born in Hungary, a genius, with a high IQ and an extraordinary memory, and had many academic achievements at a young age.<br>

                Professor of mathematics George Polya said that von Neumann could write the answer to a difficult mathematical problem he had put forward completely on a piece of paper after class (Petkovid, M 2009)<br>
                On one occasion, mathematician and computer scientist Goldstine (1980) asked von Neumann to recite A Tale of Two Cities, and von Neumann actually started reciting until he was asked to stop.<br>
                He even went to two universities in different countries at the same time, and both graduated successfully. In 1923 von Neumann passed the entrance exam at ETH Zurich, and at the same time he was a candidate for a PhD in mathematics at the Pázmány Péter University in Budapest. In 1926 he received a degree in chemical engineering from ETH Zurich, and he also received a doctorate in mathematics from Pázmány Péter University, then the Rockefeller Foundation funded him to study mathematics with David Hilbert.

            <h1>Invention of the first general computer</h1>
            <p>
                In 1930, von Neumann was invited by Princeton University as a visiting lecturer in mathematical physics. The attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought the United States into World War II. Due to his superb mathematical ability, von Neumann was invited to enter the Manhattan Project and participated in the design of the world's second electronic computer ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) which used to calculate artillery firing tables (Moye 1996). However, , the machine needs to be reassembled every time it recalculates a new program. Much of the time saved by computer calculations is wasted in reassembly.<br>

                Thus, in June 1945, von Neumann and the two heads of the ENIAC project, Eckert and Mauchly, submitted a report to the US military, titled "First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC"<br>

                In this report, von Neumann proposed for the first time that computers should be divided into five parts: arithmetic unit, control unit, memory unit, input and output devices. Among them, the arithmetic unit is used to process addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and logical operations, the control unit is used to issue instructions to the operator, and the memory unit is used to store programs and data.When a new problem needs to be calculated, the operator only needs to extract the appropriate operation instructions from the memory unit, and the rest is handed over to the machine. Compared with ENIAC, which needs to be reassembled for each calculation, EDVAC will save a lot of time for reassembling the machine.<br>

                </figure>
                
                Moreover, in this report von Neumann proposed for the first time that electronic computers should be binary. Because compared with decimal, binary is more in line with the working characteristics of electronic components, can simplify the logic of the computer. The two basic principles of stored programs and binary form the Von Neumann architecture, which is still used today. This is why von Neumann is known as the father of the computer.
