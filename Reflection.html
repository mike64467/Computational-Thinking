                The CMT119 module has taught me computational thinking which is a strategy to solve complex problems;     HTML and CSS, which helped me get a better introduction to programming languages;     and Number Systems and Data Representation, which helped me better understand how computers work.

                My previous experience of studying C and assembly language as part of my undergraduate studies was underwhelming and frustrating, and it was difficult to enjoy coding in a language that is less friendly for beginners.    However, making this website using HTML and CSS sparked my interest in programming.     I found the process of making this website, which included using online tutorials or asking classmates for tips, very enjoyable and fulfilling.     It also involved a lot of trial and error which I believe facilitated the learning process much better than the lectures. Seeing my website come closer to what I envisioned it to be pushed me to keep improving it and to learn even more advanced features.     I realized very early in the process that the lecture material alone would not be enough to make a decent website, so I often had to learn more advanced HTML and CSS from other sources.     This taught me that I have to motivate myself, especially because I do not have a strong programming background.     Learning HTML was a good way for me to gain insight into learning how to come up with and structure my code, which will be crucial in the next steps like JavaScript and Python.

                At first, I was very hesitant to attempt to design my website due to my previous experience with programming during my undergraduate studies, but my classmates helped me overcome my fear of coding and made me realize making mistakes is how we learn. I believe it was paramount for me to realize this before I embark on future studies and career.   I realized that my understanding of HTML was not thorough enough.     For example, the layout of the web page was severely affected by using window size smaller than my screen, which I later learned must be accounted for with responsive design even though web design was not the focus of this coursework, I think it is a good opportunity to practice it regardless.  I am excited to learn JavaScript as it will allow me to create even better websites.

                <p>In addition, I think my time management skills are not good enough, and I need to spend a lot of time on learning programming because I am not familiar with the programming language. Over the course of doing this project, time management came up as an issue, but I plan on improving this by following a realistic timetable as this will be crucial in my studies and future career.
